###### Problem statement

You are given two non-negative integers, ‘NUM1’ and ‘NUM2’, in the form of strings. Return the sum of both strings.

Note :

You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.

Example:

> Let ‘NUM1’ be: “5”
> Let ‘NUM2’ be: “21”
> The sum of both numbers will be: “26”.
